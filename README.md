# advocacy-learning
Public code release for "Advocacy Learning" (IJCAI 2019). The code is currently rather messy, though it should be complete. The meat of the project is in training/model.py and training/trainer.py. Note that the multi-attention net is just an advocacy net with a different training objective.
